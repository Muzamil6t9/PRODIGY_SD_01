Temperature Conversion Program ReadMe
Overview
This Temperature Conversion Program is designed to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It prompts the user to input a temperature value along with the original unit of measurement. The program then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the converted values to the user.
Features
•	Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
•	Simple and easy-to-use interface.
•	Supports conversions in both directions: from any scale to the other two.
Usage
1.	Input Prompt: When you run the program, it will prompt you to input the temperature value followed by the original unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
2.	Conversion: Once you enter the temperature and its original unit, the program will calculate and display the converted values in the other two units.
3.	Output: You will see the converted temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin displayed on the screen.
How to Run
